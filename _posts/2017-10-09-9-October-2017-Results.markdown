Play of the tournament:

Sean, having been wasted off of Bazaar, was dredging naturally. After running out of dredgers, Sean was stuck with four Grave-Trolls and a Serum Powder in hand. He drew a Cabal Therapy for the turn, cast it off his Urborg, and targeted himself naming Golgari Grave-Troll. This re-fed his graveyard and powered him through the rest of the game. Bonus: He even got some zombies out of the deal! (Unfortunately, however, our intrepid hero did go on to lose this game.)

Sam's question of the tournament: On the play, in the blind. Keep or mull?
