Brash paid host to a motorcycle and classic car show today. As regulars, they assured us we'd get our required space. It was interesting seeing a completely different interest group. Several people stopped by and commented about having played Magic when they were kids. One guy jokingly asked if anyone had a Black Lotus and Patrick immediately pulled his out. I'm hoping a couple will be interested enough to come back.

Anyway, some pics from the show:
