With [our 2018 scheduling change](http://lonestarlhurgoyfs.com/2017-12-22-Announcement-Changes-to-Vintage-Scheduling-in-2018/), we occasionally have three week gaps between Lhurgoyf tournaments. Obviously, a gap of that length would [tear us apart](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o751ZGnnh1aRKf34Q/200.gif). We don't want to have back-to-back-to-back Vintage, so we had to find something else to fill that gap. We decided that each of these "fifth Sundays" we'd hold an odd format tournament.

To that end, I'm happy to announce the first ever Lone Star Lhurgoyf Type 1.5 tournament.

Now hold on. I know what you're thinking. Big deal. It's Legacy.

Nope. We're running Type 1.5 by the old rules. Anything currently banned or restricted in Type 1 (Vintage) is banned. There are no other bannings or restrictions. That means:

* Workshops with only a playset of resistors!
* Goblins with Goblin Recruiter!
* Unpowered Oath of Druids!
* High Tide with Frantic Search but without Brainstorm or Ponder!
* Vintage Dredge with... no changes!
* Squirrels!
* And more!

Getting there: [[MAP]](https://goo.gl/maps/JbUmv9nZm1B2) Google Maps places 508 a bit off. If you're heading West on Crosstimbers, be in the right lane. Immediately after some apartments, you'll see a small driveway with a tall wooden fence and then some more apartments. That driveway is where you want to be!

Beers: Be warned - Brash exclusively makes strong beers. If you're going to have more than a couple, you should definitely have a DD or use [Uber](https://uber.com/invite/xpd86)/[Lyft](https://lyft.com/ici/SAM51400)!

Most of the tables at Brash are picnic style tables so a playmat would definitely be a good idea.

Prizes: We payout ~90% of entry fee in cash top top 4. The remainder is kept for expenses.

Brash has offered a free [crowler](http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/what-is-a-crowler-beer) of beer to our first place winner.

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Blank deck registration sheets will be available on site. Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 1PM.**
