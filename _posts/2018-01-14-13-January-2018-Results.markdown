Yesterday, we hosted the inaugural Romancing The Stones tournament. All told, 24 Vintage
enthusiasts came out to 4th Tap Brewing, breaking the record for largest Goyf Vintage event!
Players battled it out for cash and a Mox Sapphire playmat. After 5 rounds, Stu was undefeated
on White Eldrazi and took home the mat. He was joined in the Top 4 by Ben (on Shops), Alex
(on Dredge), and Ian (on a RUG pile). Fun Magic and good beer were had by all, starting 2018
and the Romancing The Stones series off right.

Our venue for the day
