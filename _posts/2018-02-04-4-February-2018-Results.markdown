Eight brave wizards made it out on this, the day of the superb owl!

Unfortunately, the full results for today were lost in a freak accident known as a "forced OS update."" These standings are accurate to their brackets. IE: first, second, three and four, five through eight.

This stack got to be a bit much for hungover Tim. All told, 8 cards were spent ensuring that Tri could get and resolve an Ancestral Recall.

Sam responds to a Necropotence with Demonic Consultation to get the second half of the Painter combo. Dan ends up Necroing to 1, choosing to die a warrior in combat rather than as a chew toy to the combo.

Will learns that Aggro isn't as fun when your opponent can steal your best fighters.
