For those of you counting, that's a whopping **29** basic lands in the top four!

You know a tournament will be good when it's proceeded by something like this.

And the tournament certainly delivered with crazy decks including... wait, this can't be right... Energy in Vintage!?

Reigning champion Chris Huckabee took it down on Young Mentor, proving he can shred the competition even when he’s playing fair Magic. Tim Everett, the sole Houston Goyf representing, put up another good showing with 2nd place, while aggro prison enthusiasts Rob and Stu rounded out the Top 4. For his trouble, last-place finisher Patrick walked away with a Juzam Djinn print.

After this successful first run, we’d like to schedule these events every 6-8 weeks. At this point January 13th is being tossed around for our next event, but that’ll be officially announced soon.

Thanks everyone for coming out, and look forward to seeing you all at the next one!
