**Location**: [Vigilante Gastropub](https://vigilantebar.com/) - 7010 Easy Wind Dr, Austin TX 78752 ([MAP](https://goo.gl/maps/5Mo7yMSdcqS2))  
**Entry Fee**: $20   
**Registration**: 11:30 registration, with a 12:00 start time   
**Payout**: $10 of each entry fee goes to Top 4; high-end playmat and invite to year-end championship for 1st Place   
**Also**: the remaining $10 of each entry fee gets you lunch!   
**Proxy limit**: Unlimited proxy   
**Proxy rules**: While we love real cards and beautifully-rendered proxies, it’s more important to us that you’re just here and playing. As such, we’re not instituting any proxy rules or guidelines.   
**Decklists**: We will be collecting decklists to post online after the event.   
 
*We will be using [Eternal Central's deck construction rules and B&R list](http://www.eternalcentral.com/9394rules/). However, please note: we will be 100% proxy, and will not be enforcing EC's rules on what printings, art, etc are legal. We just want you to come play Old School with us.* 
 
As mentioned above, for this event we've raised our entry fee to $20. As per previous events, $10 of that will go towards the prize pool. The other $10 gets you lunch, as Vigilante's worked out an awesome lunch menu for us!
 
As per tradtion, we've got a playmat for first place. Thsi time, it's Miss 1993 herself!
