We didn't announce this event as we weren't sure we'd even hold it until quite close to time. We ended up with six which is great as it allows us to run a five round tournament with round robin pairings. Stephen dropped before the final round, giving Sam a BYE that gave him the breakers to beat Joe into second place. We opted to give second to Joe, calling the heads up matchup the true tiebreaker.

Sorry that most of the pics are from my point of view. Playing a slower deck in a tiny field meant I didn't have much time to get around and take more pictures.

Popping Powder Keg on 0 with the hope that Joe doesn't realize that he can respond by making an indestructable Marit Lage. (He did)
