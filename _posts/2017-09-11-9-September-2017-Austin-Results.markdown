The Lone Star Lhurgoyfs are, of course, based in the great state of Texas. While tha majority of us are based in Houston, we do have members spread througout the state. Stu was looking to mirror the every-other-week cadence of Houston Vintage in Austin. So we planned to bring the Houston Vintage crew to Austin.

And then Hurricane Harvey hit.

Breaking many records and getting its name retired before disapating, Hurricane Harvey throrughly fucked the Texas Gulf Coast. We decided that the already-scheduled Austin tournament would be modified to benefit Hurricane Harvey relief. The entry fee was nearly tripled and the prize pool was juiced as never before. We acquired so many prizes from donations that in addtion to the usual prize pool, we added a raffle for further prizes.

In the end, we counted $922 donated to The American Red Cross benefiting Hurricane Harvey relief.

Many thanks to the following who donated cash, cards, and logistics, the Austin Magic community for coming out and throwing money at us, and the rest of ya'll who have given in any other way.
