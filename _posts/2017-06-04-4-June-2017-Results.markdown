Eleven wizards braved flash flood warnings and the traffic of a nearby music festival to play magic as Garfield intended. In a reaction to a recent spate of Workshops in Houston, we saw a big upswing in Oath decks.

We always play four rounds. Sometimes that results in some funky finishes. Today is the first time a winner has *not* gone 4-0. That meant a ridiculously close finish as the entire top 4 clocked in at 9 points.

Be sure to scroll to the bottom to see yet another super-sweet proxy deck from local madman, Will M.

Luke's first time playing Dredge. "I just mull to Bazaar, right?" Yes Luke, all the way down to that one card hand. Luke later exclaimed "wait, Bazaar isn't legendary!?"
